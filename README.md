# primeplay-React

NFL Analytics.

This project used Next JS.

To run, I did
```shell
npm install # 
npm install -g next # not sure if we need this
npm run build
npm run start
```

For development, do:
```shell
npm run dev
```

Things I want to learn:
- What is an easy way to make plotly plots with next js apps?
- How do we make them interactive in terms of users submitting input and plots updating based on input?
- What is the best way to store and fetch the data the plot is based off of? What if the data is very large?
- How do we make plots responsive and fit in containers?
- How do we make live updating plots?
